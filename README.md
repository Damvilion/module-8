How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by breaking them down into clear and actionable requirements that can be implemented. Writing user stories helps translate abstract needs into specific goals, written from the perspective of the user. This ensures I stay focused on delivering value rather than just building features for their own sake.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development by starting small, iterating quickly, and regularly testing what I build. Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives give structure to this approach and make it easier to adjust when requirements change. In the future, I want to incorporate continuous integration, sprint reviews, and regular feedback loops so I can adapt quickly and maintain steady progress.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, supporting others, and being dependable. It involves giving constructive feedback, being open to new ideas, and collaborating to solve problems instead of working in isolation. It also means respecting deadlines, being accountable for my work, and helping ensure the team succeeds as a whole.
